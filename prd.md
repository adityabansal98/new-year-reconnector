## Project: Resolution Connector (Hackathon MVP)

**Role:** You are a Senior Frontend Engineer and UX Designer.
**Goal:** Build a functional single-page application (SPA) that helps users achieve their professional New Year's Resolutions by reconnecting with their existing network.

### **Tech Stack**
* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI (Lucide React for icons)
* **Logic:** Client-side only (No database).
* **AI:** **Google Gemini API** (Model: `gemini-1.5-flash`) for analyzing goals and drafting messages.
* **Data Parsing:** `papaparse` for parsing CSV files.

### **Core User Flow**
1.  **The Resolution:** User lands on a clean page and enters a text goal (e.g., "I want to pivot into Product Management in Climate Tech").
2.  **The Data:** User uploads their LinkedIn `Connections.csv` file (Drag & Drop).
3.  **The Matching (Gemini):**
    * The app sends the "Resolution" to Gemini to generate 5-10 related job titles/keywords (e.g., "Product Manager", "Sustainability", "Energy", "CleanTech").
    * The app filters the CSV rows client-side to find people whose `Position` or `Company` matches those keywords.
4.  **The Results:** Display the "Top Matches" in a grid of cards.
5.  **The Action:** Clicking a card opens a modal with a pre-drafted, personalized message generated by Gemini to send to that person.

### **Data Structure (LinkedIn Export Standard)**
The CSV will have these exact headers:
`First Name`, `Last Name`, `Company`, `Position`, `Connected On`

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Setup & UI Shell**
1.  Initialize a Next.js app with Tailwind.
2.  Create a modern, dark-mode landing page.
3.  Center a large Input field for the "Resolution" and a File Upload zone (use `react-dropzone` or standard input).

**Phase 2: Logic & Parsing**
1.  Create a utility function using `papaparse` to read the CSV.
2.  Create a Server Action or API Route `/api/analyze-resolution` using the `@google/generative-ai` SDK:
    * Input: User's resolution string.
    * Output: JSON array of 10 keywords (synonyms, job titles, industries).
    * **System Prompt:** "You are a career coach. Given a user's professional goal, return a strict JSON list of 10 keywords (titles, industries, companies) that would appear in a LinkedIn 'Position' or 'Company' column for useful contacts. Do not include markdown formatting."

**Phase 3: The Dashboard (Client-Side Filtering)**
1.  Once the keywords return, filter the parsed CSV data.
2.  Rank results:
    * Match in `Position` = High Score.
    * Match in `Company` = Medium Score.
3.  Render the top 12 matches in a grid.
    * Card UI: Name, Position, Company, and a "Connect" button.

**Phase 4: Message Generation**
1.  Create an API Route `/api/draft-message` using `@google/generative-ai`:
    * Input: User's Resolution, Contact's Name, Contact's Position/Company.
    * Output: A generic, casual 50-word message.
    * **System Prompt:** "Draft a casual LinkedIn message to [Name] at [Company] ([Position]). Mention I am working on [Resolution] and would love their perspective. Keep it under 300 characters. No hashtags."
2.  Connect this to the "Connect" button on the card.

### **Design Vibe**
* **Theme:** "New Year, New Me." Use deep purples/blues or a clean "Notion-like" aesthetic.
* **Typography:** Sans-serif, clean (Inter or Geist).

**Action:**
Start by scaffolding the project structure, installing `@google/generative-ai`, and creating the Landing Page UI (Phase 1).
